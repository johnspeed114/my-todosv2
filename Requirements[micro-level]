[x] Should have a crossout when checked completed
    [x] Need to manipulate the prop in Todo.name in li of Todo.js
    CURRENT POSSIBLE SOLUTION: Can use CSS class name target {text-decoration: line-through}
    -maybe look for manipulate states of passed props through css?
    -first)Can onclick event have two functions? or should 
    i add the toggle class feature into handleComplete
    CONCLUSION: I created a classname for each li(which i acutally don't need the id for key) set it as a condition to add strikethrough style class in or not on the condition if item.completed was true or false

[] Double click on item, you can edit the item
    [] Double click trigger the edit feature
    [] need to probably add item.id to each of the edit features 
    -This would be kinda like the delete function
